## Overview of Project

Our client's webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, added will be a table filter for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To find the date you want to filter by, input date as "1/10/2010". The data that matches your search criteria will display.
